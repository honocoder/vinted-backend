# Vinted Backend API

This is a replica of the Vinted backend API. I built it during a fullstack JS development bootcamp, Le Reacteur.

## Built with

This API is built with Node.js and ExpressJS. The database is built with MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Some informations about this project

To build this API, we learned a lot of things :

• How to built and initialize a Node server thanks to ExpressJS
• How to declare models and routes for our API
• How to create a middleware (to verify if the user is authenticated in this case)
• How to use Cloudinary to allow users to upload picture and how to collect and use it on the different offers (using Express Formidable)
• How to host and deploy our API on Heroku | Host our database on MongoDB Atlas

## What's coming next

In a few weeks, I'll add an interface for this Vinted replica. We will use React to build the frontend of the web app.
Stay tuned to see it!
